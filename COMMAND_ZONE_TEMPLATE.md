## Recommended Deck Structure

| **Category**              | **Suggested Count** | **Notes**                                                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lands**                 | 38                  | Includes MDFCs, utility lands, land cyclers. Start at 38, adjust after playtesting.               |
| **Card Advantage (Draw)** | 12                  | True card draw or virtual access to more cards (impulse draw, exile-play, self-mill if relevant). |
| **Ramp**                  | 10                  | Mana acceleration beyond land drops. Go to 12+ for consistent early ramp. MDFCs and cyclers help. |
| **Targeted Disruption**   | 12                  | One-for-one answers: removal, counters, graveyard hate, bounce. Variety is key.                   |
| **Mass Disruption**       | 6                   | Broad answers: wraths, artifact wipes, graveyard clears, fogs, stax, etc.                         |
| **Plan/Synergy Cards**    | ~30                 | Your win conditions, synergy pieces, combos, or flavor picks.                                     |

> ⚠️ Total recommended counts exceed 100 cards due to **overlap**, where many cards serve multiple roles.

## Category Details

### Lands

- Recommended: **38**
- Use MDFCs, channel lands, land cyclers to boost functional land count.
- Missing land drops is the easiest way to lose or fall behind.
- Most players cut too many lands—avoid the temptation.

---

### Card Advantage

- Recommended: **12 minimum**, aim for 15+ for consistency or lower-power decks.
- Includes:
  - Draw engines (Phyrexian Arena, Garruk's Uprising)
  - Impulse/exile-to-play draw
  - Self-mill (only if graveyard is a resource)
- Not all cards with "draw" are true advantage (e.g., Faithless Looting = card selection, not advantage).

---

### Ramp

- Recommended: **10 baseline**, **12+** for consistency (especially with 4-mana commanders).
- Includes:
  - 1-2 mana rocks
  - Mana dorks
  - Ramp spells (Rampant Growth, Cultivate)
- **Does not include:** Temporary burst mana (e.g., Dark Ritual, Jeska's Will) in baseline counts, though they are still powerful.

---

### Targeted Disruption

- Recommended: **12**
- Includes:
  - Creature removal (Swords to Plowshares)
  - Artifact/enchantment removal
  - Bounce spells
  - Counterspells
  - Graveyard hate
- Covers single targets to handle key threats.

---

### Mass Disruption

- Recommended: **6**
- Includes:
  - Wrath effects (Wrath of God, Blasphemous Act)
  - Artifact/enchantment wipes (Bane of Progress)
  - Graveyard resets (Bojuka Bog)
  - Fogs, Propaganda-style effects
  - Broad stax or rule-setting pieces (Thalia effects)
  - Teferi's Protection is considered mass disruption

---

## Overlap and Efficiency

- Many cards fill multiple roles (e.g., MDFCs are both lands and spells).
- Look for:
  - ETB creatures providing removal or ramp
  - Modal cards enhancing flexibility
  - Graveyard interactions that double as draw or recursion
- Overlap increases synergy while meeting core deck needs.

---

## Final Thoughts

- Template is a **guideline**, not a hard rule.
- Deck tuning is iterative—adjust after testing.
- Use tools like [Archidekt](https://archidekt.com) to tag and review categories easily.
- Core takeaway: Don’t neglect the fundamentals—ramp, draw, interaction, disruption—your deck needs to "do things" reliably.
